# ConData
RESTful SQL/Access query to JSON system

This is a simple DB server that will allow you to send Queries as POST requests and receive back a table in JSON format with added metadata.

It's quite handy as a lightweight rapid testing and development system.

To start it you can create the folder C:\Data and drop the files in there.

Then run the Start_server.bat script to run the back-end part.  This will require NodeJS.

Once it starts, you can open the example provided (PurchasesPastDuePurchasesPastDue_example.html).
